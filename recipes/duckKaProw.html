    <h4>Description</h4>
        <P>Quack, Quack, Waddle! This dish is an exquisite interplay of spicy, sweet, salty, and sour. 
        With the addition of the crispy duck and the fried basil leaves, this dish can easily make anyone's mouth water.</P>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>6 or 8 eye chillies, sliced</li>
            <li>1 squeeze lime juice (optional)</li>
            <li>6 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
            <li>4 or 6 bird’s eye chillies</li>
            <li>1 large chilli, halved</li>
            <li>1 pinch sea salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp water</li>
            <li>2 tbsp dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 pinch sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>300 g duck, minced</li>
            <li>100 g green beans, sliced into 1cm pieces</li>
            <li>1 handful very large of picked bai krapow, or holy basil leaves</li>
            <li>1 freshly cooked Jasmine rice</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 tbsp oil for deep frying the eggs</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small shallow dish, mix together the chillies and the fish sauce. 
                Add a squeeze of lime, if desired, and leave to stand until needed.</li>
            <li>In a pestle and mortar, pound together the chillies, garlic and salt until they form a rough paste.</li>
            <li>Now mix the soy sauces and water together in a small bowl. Stir in the sugar until it’s dissolved.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a wok until smoking hot. 
                Carefully add the chilli-garlic paste and stir-fry for a few seconds – 
                you want to really smell everything, but you don’t want to cook it long enough to colour the garlic.</li>
            <li>Now add the duck and stir-fry until it’s cooked through. Add the green beans and stir through.</li>
            <li>Now add the liquid and stir through, allowing it to bubble up before adding the basil and wilting into the dish.</li>
            <li>Serve over two portions of freshly cooked jasmine rice.</li>
            <li>For the egg: Heat a 3cm depth of vegetable oil in a wok and, when it’s really hot, crack in one of the eggs – 
                stand back as it will most likely spit!</li>
            <li>Fry until the white is crispy and golden on the outside, but the yolk is still runny within – about a minute.</li>
            <li>Scoop out with a slotted spoon, rest gently on paper towel to drain and then pop on top of the pad krapow and rice.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the second egg, and serve with the nam pla prik on the side.</li>
        </ol>
